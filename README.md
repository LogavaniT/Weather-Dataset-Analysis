# Weather Dataset Analysis

This repository contains Python code for analyzing a weather dataset using pandas and Matplotlib libraries.

## Description

The dataset used in this project contains weather data including temperature, humidity, wind speed, visibility, pressure, and weather conditions over a period of time.

The code provided performs various analyses and visualizations on the dataset, such as:

- Displaying basic information about the dataset including data types, columns, index, and shape.
- Extracting unique values from specific columns like 'Weather Condition' and 'Wind Speed_km/h'.
- Calculating statistics like value counts, variance, and mean of certain columns.
- Renaming columns for consistency.
- Plotting temperature over time using Matplotlib.


## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
